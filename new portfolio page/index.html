            <p id="p4">Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international
                 cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team. He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional
                  medium-fast bowler. He currently represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. Kohli is 
                  widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.[4] He holds the record as the highest run-scorer in T20I and IPL, 
                  ranks third in ODI, and stands as the fourth-highest in international cricket.[5] He also holds the record for scoring 
                  the most centuries in ODI cricket and stands second in the list of most international centuries scored. Kohli was a key 
                  member of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, and captained India to win
                   the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in 2017, 2018, and 2019.[6]

                In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen. In 2015, he achieved the summit 
                of T20I rankings.[7] In 2018, he was ranked top Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold
                 the number one spot in all three formats of the game. He is the first player to score 20,000 runs in a decade.
                  In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade.[8]
                
                He has received many accolades for his performances in cricket. He won the ICC ODI Player of the Year award four
                 times in 2012, 2017, 2018, and 2023. He also won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer of 
                 the Year, on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In 2018, he became the first player to win both ICC
                  ODI and Test Player of the Year awards in the same year. Also, he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the
                   World for three consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. At the national level, Kohli was honoured with the Arjuna 
                   Award in 2013, the Padma Shri in 2017, and India's highest sporting honour, the Khel Ratna award, in 2018.
                
                In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Kohli has been
                 deemed one of the most commercially viable athletes, with estimated earnings of â‚¹634 crore (US$79 million) in the year 2022.</p></div>

                    <p id="p5">Early life</p>
                    <p id="p6">Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli,
                         worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older
                          brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[9] Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar.
                           He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[10] According to his family, Kohli
                            exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a mere three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat,
                             display natural skill, and request his father to bowl to him.[11]

                        In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli,
                         who'd espoused his younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and
                          arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma.[12] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father
                           considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing 
                           abilities merited more than just playing in gully cricket.[13] Despite his abilities, he faced the 
                           setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous 
                           factors. Prem Kohli reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs,
                            which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually
                             found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[14] He received training at the academy while 
                             simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara 
                             Enclave.[15] In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent 
                             School during his ninth-grade education.[13]
                        
                        On 18 December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a cerebral attack.[13][16] During his
                         childhood, his father played a crucial role in supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited
                          his father as the one who drove him to practice every day. He has expressed his feelings of missing 
                          his father's presence at times.[10][17] According to his mother, Kohli's demeanour shifted noticeably 
                          after his father's death. He took cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and
                           dedicating himself fully to the sport.[13] Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until
                            the year 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon.</p>

                <div class="right3"><p id="play">Playing style</p>
                <p id="style">Kohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical abilities and a dynamic
                     playing demeanour.[30][31] His customarily batting position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a 
                     slightly open-chested stance,[32] and a resolute grip on the bottom handle of his bat. He has been noted
                      for his agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings
                       whilst thriving in high-pressure situations.[33][34] In his batting technique, Kohli tends to favour
                        playing grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is appreciated for his ability to execute wrist
                         shots and his consistent prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region.Kohli has often expressed his
                          admiration for the cover drive, which he considers to be his signature stroke. He possesses a natural 
                          aptitude for the flick shot, particularly when facing deliveries aimed towards leg stump.[11] Having a 
                          limited recourse to the sweep shot, Kohli's batting technique is characterized by an emphasis on ground 
                          shots that primarily yield runs in the regions between deep square leg and mid-on.[37] Kohli is known 
                          for his composed batting technique and versatility in his play. He scores runs between long-off and
                           long-on with an aligned bat, while also possessing the ability to display a destructive streak. His 
                           combination of bat-speed and supple wrist movements enable him to craft innovative angles that disrupt
                            traditional field positioning.[38] Kohli is also a proficient fielder, recognized for his quick reflexes 
                            and sure-handedness.[39]

                    However, Kohli has a known vulnerability to deliveries that are wide of the off-stump.[40] Bowlers often exploit 
                    this weakness by targeting him with such deliveries, especially in Test and ODl matches.[41] This vulnerability
                     has resulted in Kohli's dismissal on numerous occasions.[42][43] Cricket experts such as VVS Laxman and former India 
                     cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar have acknowledged this weakness,[44][45] and former New Zealand cricketer Richard Hadlee
                      has also noted that Kohli is particularly susceptible to out-swinging deliveries.[46]
                    
                    Kohli has garnered widespread acclaim and recognition as a preeminent limited-overs batsman by cricketing experts
                     and aficionados alike.[47][4] In ODIs, he boasts an average of 65.5 runs when batting second and 51.7 runs when 
                     batting first.[48] He has amassed 27 of his 50 ODI hundreds in run-chases,[49] and holds the record for the most
                      hundreds scored when batting second.[50] In reference to his success while batting second, Kohli has expressed a
                       fondness for the challenge of chasing, relishing the opportunity to test himself and demonstrate his ability to
                        efficiently manage strike rotation and execute boundary hits.[51] His colleagues admire his self-assurance,
                         dedication, concentration, and work ethic, which are the driving forces behind his success.

            <p>Kohli's romantic association with Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma, which commenced in 2013, earned the duo the moniker 
                of "Virushka".[87] During an interview with Graham Bensinger, Kohli divulged that he had encountered Sharma for the
                 first time, when they were both were engaged in a promotional shoot for Clear shampoo.[88] Their union since then has
                  attracted significant media interest, with persistent rumours and speculations swirling around in the press, as
                   both parties remained reticent about publicly discussing the relationship.[89] On 11 December 2017, the couple
                    exchanged nuptials in an intimate ceremony held in Florence, Italy, becoming one of the most talked-about celebrity
                     couples in the country.</p>

            <div class="charity1"><p id="ch1">Philanthropy</p>
            <p class="ch2">In 2013, Kohli established the "Virat Kohli Foundation" with a philanthropic objective to support underprivileged
                 children.[114] The foundation collaborates with a selected group of NGOs to increase awareness and gather support for various
                  causes that are instrumental in advancing their mission of promoting the welfare and well-being of these children.[115][116]
                   In 2014, the foundation participated in a charity auction organized by eBay and Save the Children India, the proceeds 
                   of which were directed towards the education and healthcare of underprivileged children

            <p id="fca">Kohli invested in Indian Super League club FC Goa, which he co-owned as of 2024, reflects his ambition to support
                 and cultivate the growth of football in India. Beyond the realm of cricket, this venture served as a future business
                  opportunity for him, as he sought to diversify his portfolio after retirement from the sport.[102] In November 2014, Kohli
                   partnered with Anjana Reddy's Universal Sportsbiz (USPL) to launch the youth fashion brand WROGN. The brand specialized in
                    men's casual wear clothing and entered into collaborations with prominent retail outlets such as Myntra and Shopper's
                     Stop.</p></div>

            <p class="about">About</p>
            <p class="about1">Kohli holds a prominent place in the annals of Indian cricket. He has the distinction of being the only 
                cricketer to have been named the Player of the Tournament in the T20 World Cup on two separate occasions, in 2014 and 2016.
                [129] In terms of ODI centuries, he ranks first with 50.[130] He surpassed Sachin Tendulkar's tally of 49 ODI tons and achieved
                 this feat on 15 November 2023 in the semifinal of the 2023 Cricket World Cup, while also becoming the first player to score 
                 more than 700 runs in a single edition of the tournament.[131] Furthermore, in international cricket, Kohli has amassed 80
                  centuries, second only to Sachin Tendulkar's 100 centuries.[132] In 2018, Kohli set a record, becoming the first player to
                   score 1,000 ODI runs in 11 innings in a calendar year.[133] In 2022, he achieved another milestone by scoring 1,000 runs 
                   in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, becoming the second player to reach this feat after Mahela Jayawardene.[134] During the 
                   match against Bangladesh, he became the top-scorer in the history of T20 World Cup.</p>
